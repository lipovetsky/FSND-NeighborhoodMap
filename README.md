# FSND-Neighborhood-Map

Have you ever wanted to explore a neighborhood in Google Maps with your own application?
Now you can, with this Neighborhood Map! The way it works: you have a list of some places,
along with their street addresses. This application takes that data and plots all of the
locations on a google map! Not only that! You can click on the red markers, and you will
see a window pop up with a link to the Yelp page, an image, and the actual Yelp rating!
Not bad, huh? Enjoy the app! Oh, and did I mention that you can search for different places
and filter all of the locations? Yes. There's that. Programming is magical.

## Download the Files

Make sure you have Git installed. That being covered, it's time to clone the
git repository to your machine. Here is the command:

`git clone https://github.com/lipovetsky/FSND-NeighborhoodMap.git`


## Opening the file

Now that you have the repository cloned onto your computer, you will open up the
folder with the files from the project! All you have to do is open the index.html
file. Now, the world is yours!

## Editing/Adding locations

If you want to edit the locations, you can actually delete/add your own. Anywhere
in the world! Isn't that beautiful. Just add the following line to the locations
code at the top of the model, making sure you keep the proper formatting
with commas and such:

{title: "Empire Buffet", location: "1933 Franklin Blvd, Eugene, OR 97403"}

Of course, you will replace the title and address with your own. Enjoy!

## Concluding Words

This project is part of the Full Stack Nanodegree for Udacity. You can make
something similar, should you choose to enroll. The course is full of magic.
It's difficult, but it teaches you great skills in the world of programming as
well as productivity and project management.
